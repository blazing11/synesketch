Synesketch
==========

Synesketch works well with Processing 1.5 and [mostly][issue-2] with Processing 2.2 and 3.0a core libraries. Setup instructions:

 1. Get a copy [Processing] or at least the `core.jar` library, if you didn't already.

 2. Set the Java classpath to include it:

     * In IntelliJ Idea go to *File > Project Structure > Libraries* and point it to the path of your copy of the Processing core library.
     * Do the equivalent in Eclipse or your favourite IDE.
     * Set the `CLASSPATH` environment variable to include the path to your copy of the Processing core library.
