Synesketch
==========

Synesketch relies on [Processing] v1.x core library. Setup instructions:

 * For convenience the project class path is pre-configured to find [`core.jar` (download)][core.jar] in `lib/processing`.

 * Alternatively you can configure the class path to find it in your local installation of [Processing] 1.x.

[core.jar]: https://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~foerstda/synesketch/lib/processing/core.jar
