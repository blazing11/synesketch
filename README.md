Synesketch
==========

Synesketch works well with Processing 1.5 and [mostly][issue-2] with Processing
2.2 and 3.0a core libraries. Setup instructions:

 1. Get a copy [Processing] or at least the `core.jar` library, if you didn't
    already.

 2. Set the Java classpath to include it:

     * In IntelliJ IDEA 14 go to *File > Project Structure > Modules > Add >
       JARs or directoriesâ€¦* and point it to the path of your copy of the
       Processing core library, or
     * do the equivalent in Eclipse or your favourite IDE, or
     * set the `CLASSPATH` environment variable to include the path to your
       copy of the Processing core library.
